## General Information
- Using the Reddit API, this mini app displays subreddit & reddit data. It has search functionality and is able to display comments.
- The project was undertaken as a first attempt to build a React/Redux app from the ground up.

## Technologies Used
- React & Redux
- Moment, Skeleton & React Icon libraries
- Reddit API (Documentation [here](https://www.reddit.com/dev/api/)).

## Features
- Page loads with popular reddits & popular subreddits
- Clicking on a subreddit loads it into the 'search results'
- Search bar to search for any subreddits by name
- Toggle comments on and off

## Setup
In the project directory, run 'npm start' <br />
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in the browser.

## Project Status
Project is: _no longer being worked on_. <br />
This is by no means a perfect app, but it is no longer being worked on as we continue to extend our knowledge in other areas. We may come back to this project at a later date to extend the functionality but there are no current plans. 

## Room for Improvement
- Load more comments in the nested comment structure as seen on Reddit
- Use OAuth to allow users to login to Reddit and post comments, upvote etc. from within the mini app
- Extend search functionality to give option for accounts, posts, subreddits
